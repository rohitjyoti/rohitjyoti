<!-- Projects -->
## üöÄ Featured Projects

### Cozy Corners (Airbnb Clone)
**(Technologies: Next.js, Typescript, React, Prisma, MongoDB)**

I recently developed a full-stack Airbnb Clone using cutting-edge technologies like Next.js 13, React, Tailwind, Prisma, MongoDB, and NextAuth. This project showcased my skills in building dynamic web apps, implementing authentication, and integrating databases for user convenience.

### Tourism Promoting Website using Three.js

**(Technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Three.js)**

I designed a captivating tourism promoting website using the Three.js library in JavaScript. It allows the import and manipulation of 3D models on the site. You can explore stunning 3D models of various Indian monuments with interactive rotation and zooming functionalities. The website offers immersive visuals and valuable information on accommodations, travel destinations, and nearby stays, enhancing the user experience of exploring India's heritage.

### BetterReads Website using Spring Boot
**(Technologies: Spring Boot, Java, Cassandra, Thymeleaf)**

I developed "BetterReads," a high-performance, stateless backend application that efficiently manages a large volume of book rating and tracking data. The application offers a seamless browsing experience and personalized features for users, including user-specific book reading status. To ensure scalability and reliability, I leveraged DataStax Astra DB, a hosted Cassandra database, and integrated GitHub OAuth login for streamlined user authentication.
